<b>UC CS 21 Senior Design Project: "Machine Learning and Deep Learning: What Happens After Training?"</b>


This is a research project investigating how machine learning systems behave once they have been deployed. For now, we are researching how do these neural networks trained for classification behave in response to augmentations.
