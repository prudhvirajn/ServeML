* As a ML Engineer, I would like to know which image operations to apply for semi-supervised training, so that I can build robust ML systems. 

* As a researcher, I want to understand how networks generalize over various distortions, so that I can build resilient neural networks.

* As a researcher, I want to understand how network weights may change with image manipulations, so that I can get a better understanding of neural networks. 

* As a ML Engineer, I want to know how model size may affect generalization, to make an informed choice when selecting models.
