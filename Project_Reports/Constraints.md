# Constraints

Every project faces some constraints. We discuss some possible constraints below. 

## Economic Costs
Training large Machine Learning models requires access to paid services. 
Training using any free resources limits the number of training cycles possible and the size of models and datasets that can be used.

## Time
I am already a taking 18-credit hour semester. This constraints the time I can afford to spend on the project. 
Furthermore, time required to train models further limits the time I can spend on doing other project related tasks. 
The year long course allows a more iterative research approach.   


## Scope
The research project is an open ended questions that changes as more work is done. It continuously revised at every key milestone with my advisor.  

## Professional/Technical
The project requires knowledge in Python, Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Statistics. 
I believe I have a good foundational set of skills in these areas. 
Any specific lack of knowledge, such as specific training procedures, or equations related to Machine Learning or Image processing techniques, I can refer to pre-existing code examples or the research paper. 

## Ethical and Legal
All information or material used in the project is published research papers and open source projects. 

## Security
There are no security concerns.

## Social
There are no social impacts.

## Environmental
There is no environmental impact of this project.

## Diversity and Culture
The project has only one team member. Thus it is limited in its scope of the diversity of thought. 
Furthermore, there are existing diversity issues in research areas. 
Research papers tend to overwhelmingly be produced by a minority of countries.
This leads to solutions and datasets concentrated around culture and environment of these countries.
For example, the training procedure may use photos widely available from North America or China.
But these photos may not capture the possible conditions or exposures that a system may face in Africa or South Asia.
